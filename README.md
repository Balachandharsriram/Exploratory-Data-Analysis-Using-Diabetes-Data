🚀 Exploratory Data Analysis on Diabetes Data
Welcome to this project where we dive deep into a Diabetes dataset using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, complemented by insightful visualizations.


📚 About the Project
🔍 Goal:
Perform a comprehensive exploratory analysis to uncover hidden patterns, anomalies, and relationships in the diabetes dataset, using powerful data visualization tools.

✨ Highlights:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Summary statistics & missing value analysis

Correlation heatmaps

Distribution plots & box plots to detect outliers

Relationship plots to understand feature interactions

🚀 Technologies Used
Libraries	Usage
pandas	Data manipulation & analysis
numpy	Numerical operations
matplotlib	Data visualization
seaborn	Enhanced statistical plots

🔥 Visual Insights
This notebook is rich in visual representation, making it easy to understand trends and patterns. Some plots include:

📊 Histograms & Countplots for feature distributions

📈 Pairplots & Scatterplots for relationships

🔥 Heatmaps for correlation matrices

📦 Boxplots for spotting outliers

📝 How to Run
1️⃣ Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/Balachandharsriram/Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Using-Diabetes-Data

2️⃣ Install the required libraries (preferably in a virtual environment):

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn

3️⃣ Open the notebook:

jupyter notebook "Exploratory Data Analysis .ipynb"
🚀 Sample Code Snippet
python

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
